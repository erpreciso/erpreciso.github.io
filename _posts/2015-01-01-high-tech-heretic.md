Access to info != having the savy to *interpret*

------------

**Visualize** the info, **Sanity check** to uncover clamorous mistakes

------------

Do not copy/paste, but create

------------

*Literacy!* Learn how to write, now, and work on **What** to write

- no shortcuts

------------

Study is hard

------------

medium, tool != goal, objective

Most important obligation of technology is get out of the way
Machine exists to make our life easier
