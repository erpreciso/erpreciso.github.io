This **Clayton Christensen** book is about why successful companies fail while doing the right things.

Some takeaways:

- distinguish sustaining technologies from disruptive ones: they must be managed in completely different ways;
- give independent resources to disruptive technologies, and keep the organizational frame small and lean;
- keep in mind that you will most likely fail at the beginning, and you will have to rewrite products and plan. Use rapid prototyping and collect feedbacks.
