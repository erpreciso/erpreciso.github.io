## How to search

A simple ordered list with ways to retrieve the desired information.

* **Search the web**

Especially if you're working on a platform with strong communities, a simple search can be all you need. Don't ignore also those part of the page with "similar requests" or "users also looked for..": algorithms may know what you are looking for better than you.

* **Search in the forum**

Search in communities usually requires different steps, like logging in or special forms.

* **[RTFM](https://www.xkcd.com/293/){:target="_blank"}**

Look for the man page of what you're doing. Search the web using the "pdf: " prefix to intercept data sheets or cheat sheets.

* **Search the FAQ**

They're usually well supported, since make user's life easier is a common interest.

* **Ask a skilled friend**

It can be the simplest way, but not usually the most efficient.


## Define what you're looking for

How to communicate what you need if you first don't have it clear? Follow these guidelines to include as much info as possible to your research.

* **Down to the physic: browse the source code. Inspect**

Have a look where everything originated from. Find the logic in the system.

* **Which steps will reproduce the problem? Experiment**

Simulate the scenarios that reproduce the problem, and isolate variables as much as possible.

* **What is the expected output?**

Define what you're expecting to see; have it clear in mind.

* **What do you see instead?**

Highlight what exactly differ from the expected output, down to details.

* **What software version and operating system are you using?**

Include all relevant info regarding the environment you're operating into.

* **Let other peoplle know you've done all the steps above**

Make public the fact you've done your homeworks, otherwise people will ask you to repeat what you've already done.

* **When you have a problem, communicate the problem, do not ask an opinion on your solution proposed**

Do not jump to conclusion that because you feel the solution may be in one way, it should be there: you risk to fall in confirmation bias. Do not ask confirmation for solutions you have already delineated, but explain the root problem. That's the only thing you /people should care about, not your possible way to solve this that may be wrong in the fundamentals.
