An analysis of the Cpj (Committee to Protect Journalists) database of journalists killed from 1992
================
Stefano Merlo
2016-11-16

Main findings
=============

**Impunity**: there is an irrisory percentage (2.7%) of cases when everyone responsible of journalist's murders is convicted, including both perpetrators and masterminds.

**Deaths in Iraq not covering war**: 51% of journalists dead in Iraq after 2003 were not covering the war.

Introduction
============

Cpj, and the dataset
--------------------

The [Committee to Protect Journalists](https://cpj.org/) is an independent, nonprofit organization that promotes press freedom worldwide.

This dataset contains records of journalists deaths since 1992 where an investigation has been done, or it is in progress, to define whether a journalist's death was work-related.

Dataset, methodology and full terminology are available at [Cpj website](https://cpj.org/killed/).

Weaknesses of this analysis
---------------------------

More cleaning of data would be required to pursue other in-depth analysis; as example:

-   How is data accuracy over years? Are figures related to recent years comparable with those of earlier years?

-   Only from 2003 CPJ started collecting data on media support workers: this can skew the numbers toward following years.

-   In my analysis I considered "Unconfirmed" cases part of the population, differently than the analysis available on cpj website.

Getting and cleaning data
-------------------------

Dataset is available in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/cpjournalists/journalists-killed-worldwide-since-1992/downloads/journalists-killed-worldwide-since-1992.zip).

I used **R** as analysis software, alongside the **tidyverse** packages and the **RStudio** platform.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## Loading tidyverse: ggplot2
    ## Loading tidyverse: tibble
    ## Loading tidyverse: tidyr
    ## Loading tidyverse: readr
    ## Loading tidyverse: purrr
    ## Loading tidyverse: dplyr

    ## Conflicts with tidy packages ----------------------------------------------

    ## filter(): dplyr, stats
    ## lag():    dplyr, stats

``` r
d <- read.csv("../datasets/cpj.csv", na.strings = "") %>%
    tbl_df() %>%
    mutate(
        # clean Tortured and Threatened variables
        Threatened = stringr::str_replace(Threatened, "[\n]", ""),
        Tortured = stringr::str_replace(Tortured, "[\n]", ""),
        # extract Year from date
        Year = stringr::str_sub(Date, -4),
        Year = ifelse(stringr::str_detect(Year, "[1-2][0-9]{3}"),
                      Year,
                      ""),
        Year = as.numeric(Year),
        # add flag war yes/no based on presence of "war" string in coverage variable
        War = ifelse(grepl("War", Coverage),
                     "Was covering war",
                     "Was not covering war"))
```

What were journalists covering?
===============================

In many cases journalists were not covering a single topic, therefore I disaggregated the variable; sum of bars is not equal to number of deaths.

``` r
plyr::laply(d$Coverage, function(x) stringr::str_split(x, ",")) %>%
    unlist %>%
    stringr::str_trim() %>%
    tbl_df %>%
    filter(value != "") %>%
    group_by(value) %>%
    dplyr::count() %>%
    mutate(r = rank(n)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = reorder(value, r), y = n)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
    theme_minimal() +
    coord_flip() +
    labs(x = "Coverage",
         y = "Number of journalists killed that were covering this topic",
         title = "Number of deaths by coverage")
```

Killed by country/year not in war coverage
------------------------------------------

I focus on cases where the journalist was not covering war.

``` r
d %>%
    filter(War == "Was not covering war") %>%
    group_by(Country_killed, Year) %>%
    dplyr::count() %>%
    arrange(desc(n)) %>%
    mutate(r = dplyr::min_rank(-n)) %>%
    filter(r <= 10) %>%
    dplyr::rename(Count = n) %>%
    select(-r)
```

    ## # A tibble: 516 x 3
    ## # Groups:   Country_killed, Year [516]
    ##    Country_killed  Year Count
    ##            <fctr> <dbl> <int>
    ##  1    Philippines  2009    38
    ##  2           Iraq  2007    32
    ##  3           Iraq  2006    25
    ##  4           Iraq  2004    21
    ##  5         Rwanda  1994    20
    ##  6        Algeria  1995    19
    ##  7        Algeria  1994    12
    ##  8     Tajikistan  1993    12
    ##  9    Philippines  2004    11
    ## 10        Somalia  2012    11
    ## # ... with 506 more rows

Note the Philippines first result: this can be seen as [the worst loss of life of media professionals in one day in the history of journalism](http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/178575/news/nation/arroyo-declares-martial-law-in-maguindanao-province)

But it is interesting to note that, from this subset, 78 journalists in Iraq in 2004, 2006 and 2007 were not covering the war, that was [ongoing from 2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War)

Iraq case: war coverage by year
-------------------------------

The following graph plots deaths by year in Iraq: we can see that most of cases occur after the start of the war. We also see that there is a relevant percentage of cases where journalists weren't cover war.

``` r
d %>%
    filter(Country_killed == "Iraq",
           !is.na(Year)) %>%
    select(Year, War) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = Year)) +
    geom_bar(aes(fill = War)) +
    theme_minimal() +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Spectral",
                      direction = 1,
                      guide = guide_legend(title = "Coverage")) +
    labs(y = "Number of journalists killed", title = "Coverage by year in Iraq")
```

![]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/cpj/coverage-in-iraq-1.png)

This can be better analysed by stacking the bars and then standardising each one to have the same height.

``` r
d %>%
    filter(Country_killed == "Iraq",
           !is.na(Year)) %>%
    select(Year, War) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = Year)) +
    geom_bar(aes(fill = War), position = "fill") +
    theme_minimal() +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Spectral",
                      direction = 1,
                      guide = guide_legend(title = "Coverage")) +
    labs(y = "Proportions of killed by coverage of war or not", title = "Coverage by year in Iraq")
```

![]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/cpj/proportions-coverage-iraq-1.png)

Frequency table provides percentages by year ( but note that we lose here the weights on total number of deaths by year)

``` r
d %>%
    filter(Country_killed == "Iraq") %>%
    select(Year, War) %>%
    group_by(Year, War) %>%
    dplyr::count() %>%
    filter(!is.na(Year)) %>%
    tidyr::spread(War, n, fill = 0) %>%
    mutate(`Was covering war` = `Was covering war` / sum(`Was covering war`, `Was not covering war`),
           `Was not covering war` = 1 - `Was covering war`) %>%
    mutate(`Was covering war` = scales::percent(`Was covering war`),
    `Was not covering war` = scales::percent(`Was not covering war`))
```

    ## # A tibble: 15 x 3
    ## # Groups:   Year [15]
    ##     Year `Was covering war` `Was not covering war`
    ##    <dbl>              <chr>                  <chr>
    ##  1  1994               100%                     0%
    ##  2  2003              66.7%                  33.3%
    ##  3  2004              44.7%                  55.3%
    ##  4  2005              81.5%                  18.5%
    ##  5  2006              54.5%                  45.5%
    ##  6  2007              37.3%                  62.7%
    ##  7  2008              43.8%                  56.2%
    ##  8  2009                50%                    50%
    ##  9  2010              11.1%                  88.9%
    ## 10  2011                 0%                   100%
    ## 11  2012                 0%                   100%
    ## 12  2013              33.3%                  66.7%
    ## 13  2014                50%                    50%
    ## 14  2015                60%                    40%
    ## 15  2016                75%                    25%

Total share of deaths while covering war in all years in Iraq is showed in this table:

``` r
x <- d %>%
  filter(Country_killed == "Iraq") %>%
  filter(!is.na(Year)) %>%
  group_by(War) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  mutate(freq = n / sum(n)) %>% 
  filter(War == "Was not covering war") %>% 
  select(freq)
not_covering_war <- scales::percent(x[[1]])

d %>%
    filter(Country_killed == "Iraq") %>%
    filter(!is.na(Year)) %>%
    select(War) %>%
    group_by(War) %>%
    dplyr::count() %>%
    mutate(freq = n / sum(n),
           freq = scales::percent(freq))
```

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 3
    ## # Groups:   War [2]
    ##                    War     n  freq
    ##                  <chr> <int> <chr>
    ## 1     Was covering war   129  100%
    ## 2 Was not covering war   134  100%

From this table we conclude that 51% of journalists were not covering war in Iraq at the time of their death.

Who / What are causes of death?
===============================

From [Cpj's methodology](https://cpj.org/killed/terminology.php):

> "**Type of Death**: CPJ further categorizes each death in which the motive is confirmed. The categories are: **crossfire/combat** (a killing on a battlefield or in a military context); **dangerous assignment** (deaths while covering a demonstration, riot, clashes between rival groups, and mob situations); and **murder** (the targeted killing of a journalist, whether premeditated or spontaneous, in direct relation to the journalist's work)"

``` r
d %>%
    mutate(War = ifelse(War, "He was covering war","He was NOT covering war")) %>%
    filter(!is.na(Type_death)) %>%
    ggplot() +
    geom_bar(aes(x = Type_death)) +
    facet_wrap(~ War) +
    theme_minimal() +
    coord_flip() + 
    labs(x = "Type of death",
         y = "Number of journalists killed",
         title = "Causes of death")
```

![]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/cpj/typedeath-if-war-1.png)

Not surprisingly, when war was covered a big cause of death were combat-related actions.

I will now focus on cases of murder.

Murder perpetrators
-------------------

Who are the murderers?

From [Cpj's methodology](https://cpj.org/killed/terminology.php):

> "**Suspected Perpetrators in Murder Cases**: This refers to the person or entity CPJ has identified as most likely responsible. Categories include: **political groups** (antigovernment parties or combatants, including insurgents and terrorists); **government officials** (civilian government officials, including police); **military officials** (members of the government's military); **paramilitary groups** (irregular armed forces allied with the government); **criminal groups** (criminals or members of criminal gangs); **mob violence** (crowds of people acting together but not otherwise organized); and **local residents** (individuals inspired to violence by news coverage).".

Since these are not always defined, in some cases there are multiple suspect perpretrators for a record; I will then create a list with all perpetrators with weights in case for a record there are multiple possibilities.

``` r
dd <- do.call(rbind.data.frame, d %>%
                  filter(!is.na(Source_fire)) %>%
                  apply(1, function(x){
                      g <- stringr::str_split(x["Source_fire"], ", ")
                      g <- g %>% unlist()
                      w <- 1 / length(g)
                      return(dplyr::data_frame(source = g,
                                               ws = w))
                  }))

# check that sum of weight is equal to number of cases of murder
stopifnot(sum(dd$ws) == nrow(d %>% filter(!is.na(Source_fire))))

dd %>%
    filter(!is.na(source)) %>%
    group_by(source) %>%
    dplyr::summarise(s = sum(ws)) %>%
    arrange(desc(s)) %>%
    mutate(r = rank(s)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = reorder(source, r), y = s)) + 
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
    coord_flip() +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(y = "Number of murders attribuited, weighted in case of multiple assignment",
         x = "Suspected perpetrator",
         title = "Number of murders by suspected perpetrators")
```

Political groups are the biggest source of deaths for journalists.

Impunity
========

From [Cpj's methodology](https://cpj.org/killed/terminology.php):

> "**Impunity in Murder Cases**: CPJ monitors the law enforcement and judicial process for each confirmed murder case, and we categorize the status of the investigation. The categories are: **complete impunity** (no convictions have been obtained); **partial justice** (some but not all of those responsible have been convicted; typically, assassins are convicted but not masterminds); and **full justice** (everyone responsible is convicted, including both perpetrators and masterminds)".

Impunity analysis on all countries may be little significative due to the amount of other variables outside this database: I will instead focus on countries with the higher number of murders.

In this dataset there are `796` cases of murder.

I will analyze them in relation to geographic area.

``` r
murder_countries <- d %>%
  filter(Type_death == "Murder") %>%
  tbl_df() %>%
  group_by(Country_killed) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  mutate(freq_percent = prop.table(n),
         cum = cumsum(freq_percent))

top_murder_countries <- murder_countries %>%
    filter(cum < 0.8)
```

Over `89` countries where cases of murder are present, only `20` contribute to the 80% of total cases. I will focus on these.

``` r
d_murder <- d %>%
    tbl_df() %>%
    # select countries with 80% of murder cases
    filter(Country_killed %in% top_murder_countries$Country_killed) %>%
    # filter for where impunity info is present
    filter(!is.na(Impunity_for_murder))

# create frequency table to order countries
s <- d_murder %>%
    select(Country_killed) %>%
    group_by(Country_killed) %>%
    dplyr::count(sort = TRUE) %>%
    tbl_df()

# join dataframe with frequency table
d_murder <- left_join(d_murder, s, by = "Country_killed")

# plot
d_murder %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = reorder(Country_killed, n))) +
    geom_bar(aes(fill = Impunity_for_murder)) +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "RdYlGn",
                      direction = -1,
                      guide = guide_legend(title = "Impunity")) +
    coord_flip() +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(title = "Impunity for murders by country",
         x = "Number of murders",
         y = "Country")
```

![]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/cpj/impunity-by-country-1.png)

From this data there is 2.69% possibility to have justice after a murder case.

Is there variation of impunity over time? Focus on the 3 deadliest countries.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Is the impunity changing over time? I will focus on the 3 deadliest countries for clarity of representation.

``` r
plot_impunity <- function(country_index){
    c <- murder_countries[country_index, "Country_killed"][[1]] %>% as.character()
    d %>%
        tbl_df() %>%
        filter(Country_killed == c,
               !is.na(Impunity_for_murder),
               !is.na(Year)) %>%
        select(Country_killed, Year, Impunity_for_murder) %>%
        ggplot(aes(x = Year)) +
        geom_bar(aes(fill = Impunity_for_murder)) +
        scale_fill_brewer(palette = "RdYlGn",
                          direction = -1,
                          guide = guide_legend(title = "Impunity")) +
        theme_minimal() +
        labs(title = paste("Impunity for murders in", c),
             y = "Number of murders",
             x = "Year")
}
```

### Iraq

``` r
plot_impunity(1)
```

![]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/cpj/impunity-iraq-1.png)

### Philippines

``` r
plot_impunity(2)
```

![]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/cpj/impunity-philippines-1.png)

### Algeria

``` r
plot_impunity(3)
```

![]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/cpj/impunity-algeria-1.png)

There are so few solved murderers that a plot over time is not meaningful.

Impunity related to suspect perpetrators
----------------------------------------

How is impunity related to who is suspected to have committed the crime?

``` r
# since there may be multiple possible perpetrators for each case,
# I will create a list with all perpetrators with weights in case
# for a record there are multiple possibilities

dd <- do.call(rbind.data.frame, d %>%
                  filter(!is.na(Impunity_for_murder),
                         Type_death == "Murder") %>%
                  apply(1, function(x){
                      g <- stringr::str_split(x["Source_fire"], ", ")
                      g <- g %>% unlist()
                      w <- 1 / length(g)
                      return(dplyr::data_frame(source = g,
                                               impunity = x["Impunity_for_murder"],
                                               ws = w))
                  }))

# check that sum of weight is equal to number of cases of murder
stopifnot(sum(dd$ws) == nrow(d %>% filter(!is.na(Impunity_for_murder),
                                          Type_death == "Murder")))

dd %>%
    filter(!is.na(source)) %>%
    group_by(source, impunity) %>%
    dplyr::summarise(s = sum(ws)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = source, y = s)) + 
    geom_bar(aes(fill = impunity), stat = "identity", position = "fill") +
    coord_flip() +
    theme_minimal() +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "RdYlGn",
                      direction = -1,
                      guide = guide_legend(title = "Impunity")) +
    labs(y = "Number of murders",
         x = "Suspected perpetrator",
         title = "Impunity shares for suspected perpetrators")
```

It seems that impunity is lowest when the murders come from local residents, and is max when there are political groups or unknown fire as source of death.

Conclusion
==========

While I focused my analysis on impunity for murder and on coverage in Iraq, the datasets can offer several other analysis ideas, some of them I started in my exploratory analysis.

I also highlighted some possible flaws of my analysis, therefore data methodology and terminology must be carefully ponderated when extrapolating results, since can lead to wrong interpretations.
