* Look for different styles in question/answer format.
 
* Do not forget there is a person on the other side of the email: ask common small talk questions, how's going, how about holidays, usual stuff.

* Make them feel important: do not write in first person only, but shift the focus to the recipient.
 
* If you're writing to someone that doesn't know you, get to know the person you're writing to, tell them why you chose them, highlight uncommon commonalities.
 
* As every communication that needs to stick, tell sticky stories.
 
* Show that you’ve done your homework: if you're asking for help, people will know which alternatives you have already explored.
 
* Be short in the body, and perfect the subject line; people skim emails. Their mind looks for shortcuts, and they will assume that what they read in the first sentence is the core of the message. Emails should be 3 sentences or less. Better if you can get the whole email in the subject line.
 
* If you need information, ask yes or no questions whenever possible. Never ask a question that requires a full sentence response. Brains love to have the possibility to choose between prepared answers.
 
* When something is time sensitive, state the action you will take if you don’t get a response by a time you specify. Be as specific as you can while conforming to the length requirements.
 
* Do not over use exclamation points: re read the text, and if you feel they're too many, that's because there are too many.
 
* Include obvious keywords people can use to search for your email.
 
* And, to close: have clear roles of the conversations: if you're using a very sophisticated language, taking the time to review punctuation and grammar, and the other reply with single-word emails, or sloppy orthography, it's because you need something from him.
