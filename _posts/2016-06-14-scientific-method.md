## Conduct research like a scientist

Learn about the scientific method. Do the experiment and put your ideas about falling objects to the test.

## Misconception: there's no creativity involved in the scientific process.

Some people believe that there's no room for creativity and inspiration in science.

Nothing could be further from the truth! The ability to think creatively is very important skill in order to come up with alternative hypothesis and find new ways of thinking. Creativity also enables you to take a new perspective on old data.

## Misconception: all scientists use the same working method.

Scientists work in many different ways. The 'step by step' scientific method described earlier is a simplified version of reality. The actual process is much more complex. Science does not always include experiments. Math, for example, is based on logic. All science, however, is based on proving or disproving theories or ideas.

## What is science?

Science is the body of knowledge and the ways in which that knowledge can be acquired. Millions of scientists work together to unravel the secrets if our universe. Scientists are curious and ask themselves and each other critical questions. New knowledge benefits society as a whole and everyone in it.

There are a lot of misconceptions about what science is and how it works.

## How it works

Try to predict what the answer to the question might be: hypothesis.

They often base this hypothesis on existing knowledge, ideas and theories. Then scientists carry out experiments to see what will happens. They use the results to determine if the hypothesis was correct. Regardless of the outcome, science has progressed.

This process of asking questions, predicting, experimenting, observing and reaching conclusions is known as scientific method.

The two verbs are <strong>observe</strong> and <strong>experiment</strong>.

Let's structure it:

* formulate a question: about a process, a technology, a "fact"

* do background research: is there already an answer to this question? If not, why?

* construct an hypothesis: draft your own hypothesis to answer that question. It must be something precise, without any ambiguity or doubt; only in this way you can prove or disprove it

* test it by experiment: after your hypothesis is defined, create an experiment to test it; you should not only confirm it, but trying to disprove it. Essential is make the experiment reproducible, and clearly documented in every phase. Try to change only one variable at time, to clearly identify causalities.

* analyze data and draw your conclusion: in both cases your test was a failure or a success, you have data; analyze it, explaining what went well and what not compared to expectation; note particular mistakes that you could have done, to prevent people repeat them

* communicate results: you have now results: find the best and most clear way to communicate them, to be added to the human knowledge
