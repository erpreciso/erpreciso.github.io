Some advices from a fantastic book by [Jim Longuski - The Seven Secrets of How to Think Like a Rocket Scientist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13474.The_Seven_Secrets_of_How_to_Think_Like_a_Rocket_Scientist?ac=1), and some others from somewhere in the web; personal reflections added.

## Be aware of the situation around you

Be present with your mind, don't let the time pass without you having a place in it.


## Imagine the idea

Stop what you're doing, and imagine a visual representation of your idea.


## Do actions / experiments with your thought

Like martial arts, where you can surprisingly train yourself by visualizing movements, also experiments can be carried over significantly from the comfort of your chair. Invest some mental energy in this activity.


## Draw outcomes, situations, personae, ideas

Draw and write your project from as many angles and point of view as possible. Imagine you're a different actor every time; imagine a different scenario, a different world.


## Prepare mock-up

Scribble what you have in mind as prototype; create something the user can touch and play around. You need their feedback.


## Expand / shrink the vision

Walk away from the screen, from your room. Put some distance between you and the project: it will help you also creating different points of view within the project planning.


## Do brainstorm

Think, think and think about what you're doing. Take breaks, but then think again. Time spent on thinking is invested.



## If you tell to others, create a story and inspire desire

People listen to emotions: the more you're able to trigger, the more people will remember you.


## Evaluate and judge constraints

Find the limits of your project. Delineate them and understand how they impact your work.


## Weigh pro/cons by several ideas

Think about pro and cons for different ideas by plotting them on a table.


## List a "what if?" questions list, with answers

Consider everyone asking you "what if..." as your best friend, professionally speaking. It's the right question to discover failures of your project.


## Do not prove correctness but try to prove wrongness

Familiar concept among scientists: prove an absolute truth is impossible, but trying to prove the wrongness using the best knowledge you can put into can be a strong argumentation to prove that your project can hold steady.


## Inspect for defects

Stick your nose around to find early defects: they may be a symptom.


## Prepare a backup plan

Have an alternate plan in case things don't go as expected. But instead of spending resources to build an entire plan B, prepare mini plans to absorb risk consequences along the way.


## Do sanity checks

Question frequently if what you're doing make sense at all.


## Question the assumptions

Prove and document your assumptions. They are useful as energy-saving mental shortcuts but can be dangerous if left on their own.


## Revise: simplify and minimize resources needed

Keep as simple and minimal as possible; complexity grows exponentially with resources invested.


## Pick the best collaborators

Hire people smarter than you; you should be able to leave everything in their hand.


## Start early, and learn by doing

Process incrementally to have products to ship, you will learn things on the go.


## Use the feedback process: do, test, correct, do again

Iterate every step, and be voracious with feedbacks: consider them the best gift they can give you.


## Don't listen to happiness myths, and know the power of negative thinking

Don't visualize success, but failure. Think about what can disrupt everything in the next phase, and plan accordingly.
