**Craft a story**: wrap your idea in a story that can be easily listened and remembered from your audience. Emotions stick in mind much better than abstract thoughts.

**Prepare**: do your homeworks, and prepare the pitch; ideally you should have ready different version of the speech, one of 30 seconds, one of 5 minutes, one of 15 minutes, to cover all eventualities.

**Put visuals**: use images, they have a better impact on the understanding of the listeners.

**Better few words**: cut as much as possible, then cut again. Be concise, people will appreciate.

**Give breaks**: understand basic needs, restroom and coffee. Mind also needs to rest regularly, to fix concepts in mind and create connections by putting some distance from the topic.

**Importance of timing**: evaluate when is the best to present the different part of the speech: as example, leave less important things as last, so in case you run out of time you are sure to have covered the most important.
