Use the information, not only consume it. Learning a concept is different than being familiar with it. I will go through some techniques to help content sticks in your mind.
Take responsibility for you own learning. Listen and think. Invest energy by elaborating what you're learning. Create knowledge in you.

Main concepts are coming from the MOOC [Learning How To Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn){:target="_blank"}, from [Barbara Oakley](http://www.barbaraoakley.com/){:target="_blank"}: I strongly suggest to attend it as it goes in details of all the concepts I will scratch below. I then re elaborated everything using my own structure and words, and you will see this is one of the main tasks to do if you really want to learn something.

## Your mind

Get to know some facts about how your mind works.

### Save energy

Your daily energy resource pool is more or less given, and cannot be expanded indefinitely. Your mind has evolved to save it as much as possible.

It's constantly looking for **shortcuts**: ways to accomplish tasks with as little energy as possible, e.g. choosing always the same color for underwear to not be forced to decide which is the preferred one.

It tries to use the **"zombie mode"**: you carry over tasks without thinking about, e.g. showering or doing dishes.

It prefers **habits**: they're natural energy saver as your mind, once triggered, enter in a zombie mode and follow an automatic pilot. They start from a *cue*, the trigger to go in zombie mode: e.g. a notification sound that triggers the habit to check your social network apps. It's no harmful itself, but very powerful in creating an inner desire to start the *routine*: the habitual response of the brain to the cue, e.g. pick your phone and check for notification: carried in zombie mode, they require only a short amount of mental energy (I am not referring to the energy to interpret the actual content of the message, but to the activity to read it, so pick the phone from the pocket, unlock, open the app: you can do all of this completely automatically, not investing anything in terms of mental energy). Once routine is completed, we get the *reward*: a little feeling of pleasure. You don't realize, but after checking your message or whatever, and see the notification icon disappear, you feel a little sense of reward to have completed a task: this is coming from dopamine, a natural drug, released on reward occasions, that gives you a sense of pleasure. To change an habit you should change the reaction to the cue. Recognize it: location, time, how do you feel, reactions. Try to switch off potential distractions. To change a routine, you should have a plan to develop the new one, e.g. leave the phone somewhere else or find a quieter place to retire.

When you work on concepts that force your mind to focus on something not wanted, you use an area of the brain that is associated with actual pain.

### Create information

Your mind can work in focused more or in diffuse mode.

In **focused mode** you activate a part of the brain that raise the concentration to the maximum. It shut down all other stimulus to focus, and work in a sequential way, following patterns and causal reasoning.

In **diffuse mode**, you're simply not focused on the topic anymore with the conscious part of your mind, but you're actually re elaborating it in background, and the topic will collide with all other thoughts you may have while thinking about something else, since the approach is more holistic than the focused one.

### Save information

Our mind stores information in **chunks**: logic units of information, related together by meaning or use; concretely, network of neurons fired together that synthesize an idea. First step on learning is **create** them; through practice and repetition you acquire mastery in this activity, till creating your personal library to be constantly reviewed in background to be mixed with new info is coming into.

Best is associate a chunk with an **emotions**; images also work pretty good, while abstract concepts are the hardest to stick in mind.

There are two different memory types: working memory, that can hold up to four chunks of information, and long term memory, that is immense.

When you sleep, your brain is actively indexing the knowledge acquired during the day. An appropriate **circadian rhythm** is fundamental for an efficient elaboration: the average cycle is 90 minutes, so plan your rest to have not less than this duration without any interruption (we're not referring here to power naps, when, in opposite, you must not exceed 15-20 minutes to not fall in the same condition of deep sleep and therefore requiring the full 90 minuted cycle). In details, sleeping shrinks space between cells in brain and washes away toxins, cleaning a good environment free of poison. New synapses are created, and it goes over and over these because of the deactivation of the frontal part of the brain, resulting in stronger mental structure. Dreaming about the topic, positive behavior as it reinforce sticking to mind, can be enhanced by studying just before the sleep.

## Time

We're different between each other in terms of day rhythms: some of us like wake up early, some others go to bed late. Therefore, all **your biological activities adapt to your schedule**: when you eat, when you sleep, and also when you're most receptive for learning.

**Get to know yourself, and adapt the studying hours for when you feel is the day part where you're most productive.** Morning persons are usually more creative in the first hours of the day, while night owls may have energy peaks late in the evening. Adapt the schedule at your body, not the opposite. Once you have the plan, be disciplined in this, and you can do by creating **routines**.

They are energy-saving shortcut: if you save energy by following patterns and avoiding decisions, you have saved energies to invest on what you're working on. Find a favourite snack and have always it only during breaks: don't lose time and energy to decide what to eat.

Commit yourself to certain tasks every day. Keep a **planner** journal: write a weekly learning goal list, and write a daily to-do list for the day after, going to bed without it in mind. Important to relax: Plan the quitting time: sometimes you're so deep in work that you forget to rest, and you don't notice the performance drop.

Repeat, refresh the concept learnt periodically. Memory works best if reworks and **re elaborate the same concept after some time** from the first assimilation. Use flashcards and space repetition software.

Give importance to **relax**: when you are ready to rest, recall for a second what you're working on; (this is different than active thinking, when you actively work and think about something. This is just recall the concept, and then go back to rest, that can be something completely different like a book or a movie or your family). The work will be done by your mind in the background, without you noticing it: connections will be formed, and concepts re elaborated, sorted, indexed, till something will be triggered and you'll experience a "aha" moment: suddenly the solution you struggled for hours appears clearly in front of you, and, happy, you will ask yourself how you didn't think about it before.

In the long term, start the custom to take a week away from the routine and just read. Choose, from all various subjects, a number of books you can reasonably read in the time you allocate, and get away from everything else. It will give you some fresh thoughts, and help on creativity by priming new areas for new connections.

Studying is impacted by the **mood**: when you're angry it doesn't work. You can't focus. Be prepared to spend appropriate time on a problem, since the process can be slow.

## Prepare

Make yourself **comfortable**: shape the environment as best for you. Someone might like a slightly noisy background, someone else complete silence. Once you found your perfect situation, perfect it: if you go for silence, invest in a sound-reduction headphone device; if you go for noise, look for what you like most, like a quite café or a children playground or just a nearby park.

Studying requires lot of energy: **recharge yourself, eating and drinking regularly**. Have always snacks and water ready for a studying session, do not try to attend a 4-hours lecture without energies or your attention will decline dramatically.

## Share

Study with teammates else is better since you have possibility to immediate feedbacks and reciprocal support. It also help you avoid the mistake of **overconfidence**, when you self review your work, making mistakes due to the focus mode without noticing it since you're both the doer and the controller. If you're by yourself, stop, breathe, and review your work.

Don't be afraid when interacting with others to stop and question what you're listening. It gives you opportunity to change the focus and use diffuse mode for a while, to review the topic and come out with more questions.

Get an expert in the field and be a student. Be **curious**, share projects, ideas and thoughts, ask feedbacks. Find meetups, hangouts and join. Create a circle, a community, a network of contacts.

## Study

Give sense to what you’re reading. Implement in your behavior a **situational awareness**: keep receptors up and running, not in focused mode but in the diffuse mode sessions.

Taking some fresh air can be very helpful to recharge: walk outside during the breaks; or simply get off the chair and look out the window; it helps also to **change the distance** to the topic, switching between wide and narrow approach. Cook, do workout, walk; the important is you stay active: this is not relax time, but time when your brain is working actively in the background and it needs stimulus and energy.

Focus. Your mind is trying to go somewhere else, but you need to focus. Not everything can be put "on hold". A great tool to use is the **Pomodoro tecnique**.

Split the work in sessions: a 25min work / 5 min break split is commonly used, but you can adapt it as you prefer. You just put a timer and a piece of paper close to your workstation, switch off every distraction, and set a 25 minutes countdown: during this time you are allowed to focus on your work only. If anything else pops in mind, write it down and go back to work. Visualize it as if physically you are "putting down" the thought that arrived, so you can free the way for the thinking flow you were following. Once the timer is end, you can have a 5 minutes break where you have a snack, chat with colleagues, check your phone or whatever you feel like; the important is that you move away with your mind from what you're doing. Once break ends, you restart. There are advanced uses, like keeping a journal and such, but the simple steps above are more than enough to give you a relevant jump forward in productivity. Make it an habit: the timer is the cue, the trigger; the session is the habit; the 5 minute break is the reward.

This gives you the opportunity to leverage the alternation of the focused and the diffused mode: changing periods of intense focusing activity on the subject, when brain generates connections, with periods of getting away from it, makes your brain organize, index and assimilate info. Boost this by stimulating physical process of releasing chemicals by moving your body: go for a walk in the short breaks, and workout or exercise in longer pauses; physical activity enhance new neurons production. Do not forget a notebook, since your brain's diffuse mode is going full speed.

You can focus as much as you can, but you cannot avoid certain things that you really don't want to do. In this cases your brain is subject to actual pain, even if not noticed by the conscious part of you. The first defense of your mind is the **procrastination**.

If there are activities that you don't want to do, and tend to procrastinate, try to **re frame focusing on the process (the habit) rather on the product (the outcome)**: our mind zombie likes processes to go through mindless, rather that seemingly impossibles outcomes. But zombies can't learn! Or try to create little challenges, and promise yourself a little reward: your brain triggers the same chemical reactions when you receive it and when you expect a future one.

A proactive way to avoid procrastination is avoiding **procrastination cues and triggers**: like the notification of your mobile, that gives your brain the rope to pull to sneak out of the studying activity. Cut them out from the beginning: turn it off.

Never underestimate the power of your unconscious mind versus the conscious: if you are definitively not in the mood for something, give up. Have always ready a plan B, that can be a different subject to study, a different relax activity, or just the option 0: do nothing.

A case where procrastination is actually helpful is when you are learning new concepts, or solving new problems: by definition you cannot solve new problems with your existing knowledge because they're new! Wait, and let new ideas come in mind while exercising or doing something different.

From all these approach you see that the best strategy to approach learning is **alternate** periods of intense focus with periods of wandering around with different things; a similar method of diversifying topics you work on is the **interleaving**: plan an alternate of different topics during the study session, e.g. two focused session on topic A, then a session on B, then two on C. This mixing of learning techniques activates different part of the brain: a paper writing session may trigger the creativity, while some new project drafting may involve some algebra and a more linear thinking. You just need to have accomplished a basic learning unit before jumping to something else, or you risk to haven't formed any pattern or clue on the topic and losing everything. But once you have acquired some basic, don't be afraid to close the subject, do the scheduled break, and restart with something different. Your brain will continue to keep the previous subject in background, doing his cleaning and indexing activity, while you are already focusing on something else: ideas will literally collide one with each other, and some aggregations may form and problems may be solved in creative ways. It's the concept of **tranfer**: chunks can be connected not only to similar chunks but also to different field's chunks. Expertise in one discipline can be deep, but in many disciplines can bring to interesting new connections between fields and enhance creativity.

This is different than multitasking, where we (try to) work on different things at the same time, usually ending with very poor performance: this is actively working in parallel on different topics using context switching. Often things go in parallel: if you're stuck in a topic, switch to the next, and possibly the answer to the first will pop up in a second time.

## Err

Biases you don't know you're falling into

**Illusion of competence**
Passive rereading gives you illusion of competence because material becomes easy and fluent, so easy to process. Minimize highlighting, it can remove focus from where required

**Einstellung**
Happens when you have memorized something and later discovered that is not correct: if it's eradicated it prevent the "correct" thought to be formed and can prevent better solutions or idea to come to mind. It needs to be unlearnt.

**Overlearning**
continue to review concepts that have already been impressed in mind, because they're familiar, therefore easily recallable, therefore source of immediate reward and dopamine. It's a waste of learning time; once got the base of the concept, stop and try to focus on more difficult material with deliberate practice.

## Suffer

How to deal with advanced topics? From what above, everything seems so easy, but things change when you deal with an higher level of difficulty.

Start with hard problems and switch to easy as soon as you're stuck. Eat your frog first, working on the most difficult, challenging or unwanted task first thing in the studying session.

Let's draw a line between basic and advanced concepts. Basic means stuff where other stuff originate from: e.g. linear algebra can be seen as base for calculus, and calculus can be base for physics. Chemistry can be base for biology, and biology can be base for genetic. If you're studying a basic concept, try to explore briefly an advanced one deriving from it: understanding more complex reasoning will force you not only to understand the basics, but mastering and recalling them over time. And usually advanced topics are more fun: do you prefer read about impersonal sin and cosine, or simulating a rocket trajectory? Some chemical compounds, or cell reproduction? Secret is stimulating your brain's inner curiosity.

Similar is the concept of **deliberate practice**: do not spend so much time in things you have almost completely understand, but try to push forward and explore more advanced topic step by step: the continuous increase of the complexity will boost your understanding of all predecessor steps, helping the learning and fixing concepts in mind.

Break down concepts in sub concepts, tasks in subtasks. "Divide et conquer". Be sure to understand first the little pieces, before re aggregating them. Join them together later gaining context, understand how and when use the chunk, how they suit in the frame of the big picture: bottom up learning (chunking) combined with top down learning (big picture). Focus on why these pieces are connected, on the patterns.

Use the Feynman method: pick a white paper, and draw the concept down. No need for sophistication: just scribbling helps your mind re elaborating the concept. Narrow down to details, and be sure to cover everything. The more you visualize abstract concepts, the more they will stick. Try to work as if you were explaining the concept to your grandma: forcing to find simple words and ideas will help to clarify patterns and dependencies of the reasoning. Be systematic: use the ADEPT method - on a topic, find an Analogy, a Diagram, an Example, a Plain English description and a Technical description.

Leverage serendipity: when need to learn very big stuff, a strategy can be give up for a while, focus and learn to one random concept, and then use diffuse mode and wait for others to come. It doesn't look a very smart strategy, but the reality is that you cannot actually learn everything they throw on you with same level of difficulty: there are easy topics, hard topics, and extremely hard ones; and the time you can invest can't be expanded indefinitely. So just try.

## Fix

Learn by doing: simulate the concept, draw it down, visualize it in your mind and actively take part of it. The more fun you have doing this, the more it will sticks. Apply the concept to something it refers to, visualize a real-case scenario: practice or challenge it.

Your mind works better following patterns, and finds easy to store them. Find them, visualize and write them down. Look for associations and analogies with what is similar and you already know. Search connections, similarities, comparisons, examples, and try to form a chunk with every one of them. Then associate an image to every chunk, and build a story to connect them, the craziest the better.

Visualization is better to stick in mind than abstract concepts. Use metaphor and analogy: metaphor sometimes is just realize that one idea is similar to another. The more visual, the better. Seems weird, but try to pretend you are the concept you are trying to understand.

Metaphors and analogies are also useful for getting people out of Einstellung. Use mnemonic to learn concepts like associate visual images to things a problem in the wrong way.

## Test

The feeling that you're learning is not enough: you may easily fall into overconfidence. You need stronger proofs.

Challenge yourself reading paragraph of the text, creating a test or a question and trying to answer after a while. This makes your mind reprocessing what you've learnt, sticking it to mind. You can prepare questions while you're reading, but answers are more effective if given after a while. Find your weaknesses, and work on them. Mistakes are important because help to collect and process information. Attention: looking at the solution is not like having reached the solution, do not fall in confirmation bias.

Process which this is based on is the **recall**, recalling information to be reprocessed, therefore fixed better in mind. Passively rereading is not as helpful as retrieve them from mind. To boost this process, use space repetition: recall and repeat concepts after few days, better in a different environment to enhance the diffuse mode. There are some tools for this, from flashcards to software using this space repetition algorithm,

If you work with someone else, evaluate each other and exchange feedbacks. Build rubrics to check the works, they will ensure continuity in the review process.

## Remember

Now that you consider the topic learned, the best way to maintain it, and consolidate the knowledge, is to help others learning. Visit regularly forums and communities, and offer to help. It gives you the opportunity to adapt the concept for different audiences, and re elaborate the message, good strategies to stick it in mind. You will invest time, because it's investment in development.

Recall concepts over time; use a spaced repetition software like [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/){:target="_blank"}. It will refresh concepts and strengthen long-term connections.
