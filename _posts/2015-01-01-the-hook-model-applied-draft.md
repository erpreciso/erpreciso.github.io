## Step 1: find the habit zone

### What are the habits your business model require?

Be confident with online shopping


### What problems users want to solve?

There are hundreds of online stores that sells clothes, but the biggest problem the customer has is not only that he cannot touch physically the item (driving so the go/no go decision to purchase), but also he, once decided for go with the purchase, he cannot try it and decide which size fit best. With this device the user can share anonymously his measures with the community, and receive a feedback from who has already performed the transaction.


### How are they managing this now?

* trial and errors (buy, try and in case return or recycle)
* support requests to customer service
* try in a physical store


### How frequent do you expect users will come? Note: old habits die hard and new products or services must offer dramatic improvement to have users change routine and embrace your new product, doing the huge pain of relearn

This is a dramatic improvement, so expectation is that user will return forever


### What user behavior you want make an habit?

**For the correct function of the model is mandatory to build the community, so the habit should be the feedback left**


## Step 2: analyze the trigger

* Focus on what people actually do in a behavior, rather on what they instead would like to do (watch cats video rather than quality insights)
* Think about user narratives, and the personae, putting yourself on the user's shoes and look from her perspective


### Who's the user? What's her habit now right before the one you're proposing? Which are the internal triggers she's experiencing?

Think about the 5 whys rule and come out with some internal triggers proposal

### Why the user should use my product?

To have a precise measure of his part, and purchase the right size the first time and avoid delays and waste of resources


### Why he cares about wasting money or resources?

Because most peopleÂ don't want waste time or resources


### Why he will leave a feedback after purchasing the good?

* because it will be called to do
* because he earns something
* because is mandatory for using the device the next time


### Why will he purchase my product the first time?

Because he knows him from the marketing campaign

### Simulate: when the *trigger* will happen, the user will do *this habit*

### Which can be an external trigger to be shot at a precise moment to synchronize with the internal one?

A "call to action" email

Be creative, think outside the box and brainstorm for each of these points above


## Step 3: call to action

Think about how to leverage cognitive biases in your favor to trigger an action: an idea is to use some cards with a cognitive bias on each, and brainstorm how to apply to the situation (see <a href="http://getmentalnotes.com/resources" target="_blank">getmentalnotes</a>)

Think about the idea from the process perspective, and divide it in steps

* How much from the trigger to the expected reward?
* How it compare, in simplicity, to the examples in the book?
* How it compares to existing alternatives?


* Which are the constraints for the user? Time, complexity, money, social deviance, physical effort, non-routine?
* Brainstorm and keep it simple!


## Step 4: reward

* Magic word to append to gain satisfaction: "But you're free to accept or refuse"
* Speak to some potential users of my product and ask if there are delightful moments, and what they're enjoying more
* Review the steps: what is the outcome / reward that alleviates user's pain? Is it fulfilling, or leaves the user want more?
* Brainstorm the different kinds of reward: from the tribe (gratification from others), from the hunt (material goods, money, information), from the self (mastery, completion, consistency, competency)


## Step 5: have users investing

* IKEA effect: higher value perceived just because users put their work in the product. How do you apply to your product? Which bit of work are you proposing?
* How to add investment by loading the trigger and saving value as data, information, content, skills, followers
* Analyze how much loading time for the trigger: can the cycle be shortened?


## Step 6: where are you in the matrix?

Only who build a product to improve the user's life, and he himself is willing to use, can be reasonably successful.</p>

## Step 7: test the habit

Test the habit itself rather than the product, analyze triggers and if the habit is the one that was intended
