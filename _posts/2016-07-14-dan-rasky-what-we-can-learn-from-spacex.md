This post summarizes, in order of importance, the most succesful characteristics of SpaceX compared to NASA, in terms of project management, research & development and organization, as seen from Dan Rasky in a series of interviews at [http://www.nasa.gov/content/dan-rasky-video-interviews](http://www.nasa.gov/content/dan-rasky-video-interviews){:target="_blank"}.

Dr. Dan Rasky is an internationally recognized expert on advanced entry systems and thermal protection materials. He has developed his expertise working five years for the U.S. Air Force and more than 20 years for NASA. In the 1990’s, he and his research colleagues at NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Calif., invented a heat-shield material called Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA) that has subsequently been used on several NASA as well as private industry spacecraft. For this achievement, Rasky received the NASA Inventor of the Year Award for 2007 – the first ever for NASA Ames.

## Design collaboratively, and create common incentives

When organizations are organized in closed compartments, individuals have incentives to work for that compartments rather than for the company; distributing stock options as part of the salary leverages self incentives to contribute to the success of the entire company to reach a common goal.

Research and build the facility where there's abundance of talented resources, and grow a fertile ground to create human knowledge assets.

In SpaceX many engineers have possibility to see their own hardware fly, rather than only develop it on paper and then wait decades to have it implemented on a machine. This is very reinvigorating, lowers drammatically risk adversion, and opens the way to a more creative approach.

## Organize like a startup

Traditional companies have a hierarchy derived from military, with a chain of command. SpaceX keeps small teams that organize themselves in a flat organization: this is a startup model proven to work very well, and the transition to a bigger structure so far has been conducted succesfully.

Focus on few projects at time: keeping a small number of open projects and products allows teams to stay focused on clear goals without splittig their mental resources on several topics at time.

## Prototype rapidly

In SpaceX there is an extensive research on new technologies: they constantly keep eyes open, and as soon as something new appears in the field, they immediately research, make contact, study and prototype.

This is done at light speed: to test a new concept or an hypothesis they build first a small scale prototype, and then a full scale one. This allows then to validate or not hypothesis, and leveage what in software design is the Beta tesing: ship to customers even if the product is not 100% perfect and complete. In this way they collect precious feedbacks early in the process, and can move forward or step back before it becomes too complex or costly.

## Apply software design workflow and use sparse matrix decision approach

In decision making, an approach can be to chase down 100% of possible concerns that arise from a decision. Using instead what is called "sparse matrix approach", SpaceX move ahead if reachs 51% of agreement. In this way they progress very fast, and in case a decision is later revealed bad, they backtrack and take a different path from that point.

## Co-locate in a collaborative work environment

In SpaceX they tend to avoid traditional meetings where only one talks and all other listen: they use instead impromptu meetings, where you just stand up and look for who you need, and you go and talk.

Engineers are in the shop in glass cubicles together with people that actually build what they design: they can immediately jump in in case of issues, and they can see with their eyes result of their planning.

Those that cannot work with noise simply wear headphones, but it's enough for them to raise their eyes to be in the field.
