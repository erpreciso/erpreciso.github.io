In the next meeting you'll attend, have this list handy, and look at this at the first coffee break; evaluate which behaviors you're adopting, and reflect if it's what you actually want and what instead is an unwanted message you're communicating.

* **You don't listen** Sometimes your mind starts going around; it's frequent, if the topic is not the most appealing, that your brain try to catch every possible bit of information that gives the opportunity to fly away. But you should consider to actively contrast this, because the speaker will notice this. For example, in a short delay in responding to eye contact, or following an active question.  
* **You look like you don't listen** It's rarer than the above, but can happen. You might follow in the mistake to listen carefully but moving faster than the speaker in the thinking. But you're likely going on your own, so write down a note, and go back to listen.  
* **You don't fulfill agreements you do or tasks you take in charge** We're talking here about little commitments like take minutes of the meeting, or collect some research in advance. Not end-of-the-world cases but little annoying moments while you're requested to update the team on that task you're supposed to prepare, and you have to mumble "Sorry, [replace with an excuse]". Avoid.

* **You're too much/too little aggressive in your voice** Ask a trusted colleague feedbacks after every meeting; you are biased to not realize how you're perceived externally. How many time you personally have heard "Come on, I was just trying to [replace here with the argument he was screaming about]".

* **You make too much/too little eye contact** Also for this you should definitively ask someone, but in this case it can be external of the working environment since it's likely a trait of your personality.

* **You fidget** This can be a way for you to get more comfortable in case what you're listening is not completely as you expect; but it's usually perceived as you're bored.

* **You're too friend of everyone** Balance taking positions for who you care with taking position for what you care.

* **You don't listen to advises because you're too self confident** Actively stop thinking about the answer you already have in mind, and listen to the speaker. Question your assumptions.
