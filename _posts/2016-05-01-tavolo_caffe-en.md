Two slabs of Douglas wood 120 χ 40 χ 4 centimeters, and some sticks 9 χ 9 for the legs.

The difficult part is to saw in straight lines. I used jigs to guide the blade, cutting a quarter section at a time.

The bottom part is made by two laminated Pine board 120 χ 40 χ 1,8 centimeters.

All joined with dowels and a few screw.

I painted with mahogany-color paint, and some lack, but it turned out to be very soft and it can be scratched very easily.
