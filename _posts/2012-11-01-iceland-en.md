# The Plan

<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1uhPODOvqY2GKapw0Oq1gtCrT3_k" width="640" height="480"></iframe>

The original plan, in red in the map above, was to cross the higlands from est to west, and I prepared myself with an appropriate research of the most likely conditions in fall. My conclusion was that I had 50% of possibility to inability to pass due to snow, and this is what happened. I started to gain elevation, and already at 500 meters conditions were already impassable. I met a trekker that came from the mountains and confirmed that the track was closed.

Some days later I found a confirmation on a local newspaper.

I then gave up and biked along the south coast, in green in the map, already biked the previous year, but I appended two days in the highlands close to Reykjavik, that gave me precious experience for the next time.
