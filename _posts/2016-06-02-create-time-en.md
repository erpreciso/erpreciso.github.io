# How to create time

Time can be perceived much differently based on what you're doing: incredibly slow if you're in a situation of fear, incredibly fast if you're happily working on something interesting.
Here some thoughts from around the web on how to create time, and my reflections for each bullet.

## Eliminate or reduce media but keep a minimum of social networking

Every hour you spend wondering around in the cyberspace is one hour less invested in your personal growth, in your family, in your relax. Question every single minute you spend online: are you actually pursuing an objective? Are you gaining some new information, or just rereading what you already know?

Remember the confirmation bias: we tend to seek information that confirm what we already know, leaving out what is against our belief. Question what you're reading online; and seek for new opinions.

Free your inbox from clutter: when cleaning it don't just blindly archive or delete: do you have a newsletter that is not relevant anymore as it was at subscription? Unsubscribe. Those 5 seconds you take to archive or delete are not only pure time lost but also an interruption of your thinking flow.

## Embrace procrastination

Procrastination is not evil. It might make you more productive. First, it shorten the time remaining before a deadline, and under pressure we usually give our best. But also open up possibilities for new connections before you work on the problem.
The best approach is, anyway, not just not-do, but an "active" procrastination:

1. think about the problem you have to solve, the product you need to work on, the task you should complete
2. skim mentally the information you already have
3. let your mind wander around
4. follow any lateral thinking these information are stimulating in you. Open a map and follow the new places that pop up in mind; research for the new idea suddendly appearing; jot down notes.
5. let serendipity enter you
6. ... procrastinate...
7. start to actually work. Only now you should beat distraction by getting up before it rises


## Embrace social media

Keep the minimum of social life enough to maintain networking. Keep a constant refresh of your contacts.


## Take a screen-free walk at lunch

Relax your eyes, and refresh your mind. Let some world enter in your thinking.


## Skip the coffee, and call someone

Social interaction can be an energy booster, and a source of new ideas.


## Future cannot be predicted from anyone

Embrace a little insecurity. Be aware of projections and previsions: live with the weather that happens.


## Hope is not a strategy

It's a tool, it gives self-confidence, but cannot be considered an asset. Be aware of the reassurance it gives you.


## Make time less precious

Put in your calendar some time where you just do nothing: walk instead of take the bus, or arrive early to an appointment. Keep a notebook handy: it's easy to fill with scribbles if you let your mind wandering around.


## Uncertainty is a resource

It's another tool, consider it critical during planning. It's not necessarily bad since it may open opportunities, but plan possible risks for this approach.


## Take risks only if you're prepared to

Brainstorm and think about as much risks as possible. There is not absence of risks, just a lower possibility.


## Diversification is a strategy

Invest in a wide range of options, and maintain weights monitored.


## Refuse low-value activity, proposal, people

Time is the most precious resource you have: don't waste it with people you don't want around.


## Stay healthy and active

Train yourself to wake up without an alarm clock. Seriously, it can be done if you have a minimum of regularity. Plan your weekends so you can relax and revitalize
