# First, search yourself for a solution

1. **Search the web**

Especially if you're working on a platform with strong communities, a simple search can be all you need. Don't ignore also those part of the page with "similar requests" or "users also looked for..": algorithms may know what you are looking for better than you.

2. **Search in the forum**

Search in communities usually requires different steps, like logging in or special forms, but they might be more helpful than web searchs.

3. **[RTFM](https://www.xkcd.com/293/)**

Look for the man page of what you're doing. Search the web using the "pdf: " or the "!pdf" prefix (depending of the search engine) to intercept data sheets or cheat sheets.

4. **Search the FAQ**

They're usually well supported, since make user's life easier is a common interest.

5. **Ask a skilled friend/colleague**

It can be the simplest way, but not usually the most efficient. Do only of this won't cause an excess of involvement.


# Define what you're looking for

How to communicate what you need if you first don't have it clear? Follow these guidelines to include as much info as possible to your research.

- **Down to the physic: browse the source code. Inspect**

Have a look where everything originated from. Find the logic in the system.

- **Which steps will reproduce the problem? Experiment**

Simulate the scenarios that reproduce the problem, and isolate variables as much as possible.

- **What is the expected output?**

Define what you're expecting to see; have it clear in mind.

- **What do you see instead?**

Highlight what exactly differ from the expected output, down to details.

- **What software version and operating system are you using?**

Include all relevant info regarding the environment you're operating into.

- **Let other peoplle know you've done all the steps above**

Make public the fact you've done your homeworks, otherwise people will ask you to repeat what you've already done.

- **When you have a problem, communicate the problem**

Do not ask an opinion on your solution proposed, you might fall victim of [Confirmation Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias){:target="_blank"}.

- **Provide a [Minimal, Complete and Verifiable Example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve){:target="_blank"}**

As short but focused as possible: if the problem is a failed job, there is no need to include all previous logs from the beginning of time. Most of the times the support team can retrieve themselves the history, if properly addressed to the correct job type.

Being minimal doesn't mean being incomplete: do not omit information just because you think they're not relevant. Provide all steps that you followed that caused the issue, in order for the support team to repeat them: they must be able to recreate the same your environment.

Once filled the request, try to have a fresh look and **recreate the issue using only what you just described**: this will show you if you forgot important details, or included unuseful information. Even better if you can have a colleague review it before submitting.


# Be good

- Always write assuming that the person reading your message is busier on more important topics than you are.

- Be concise, and reread what you wrote to check for missing words or autocorrection issues that might jeopardize the message.

- Use a good subject line: it will be the first sentence read by the recipient. Avoid "Re: Re: Fwd: - help".

- Do not blindly forward other people's message, but re-elaborate with your own words. It help everybody by approaching the problem with fresh minds, and give yourself accountability on the issue.
